# 🛡️ Main Page Protection Policy

> **Status**: ACTIVE  
> **Applies to**: `/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`  
> **Effective Date**: June 27, 2025  
> **Priority**: CRITICAL  

## 📋 Executive Summary

The main page (`page.tsx`) is the most visited page in our application, receiving 80%+ of all traffic. After a successful refactoring that reduced its size from 1,154 lines to 27 lines (97.6% reduction), this policy establishes strict guidelines to maintain its performance and simplicity.

## 🎯 Policy Objectives

1. **Preserve Performance**: Maintain sub-10ms render times
2. **Prevent Regression**: Keep the page under 30 lines of code
3. **Ensure Maintainability**: Zero business logic in the page component
4. **Protect Investment**: Safeguard the refactoring effort

## 📐 Technical Constraints

### File Metrics (MUST MAINTAIN)
- **Total Lines**: < 50 (including comments)
- **Code Lines**: < 30 (excluding comments)
- **Imports**: Exactly 2 (React + QRGeneratorContainer)
- **Functions**: 1 (default export only)
- **Complexity Score**: 0

### Prohibited Elements
❌ **NEVER ADD**:
- State hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- Effect hooks (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`)
- Memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`)
- Refs (`useRef`)
- Event handlers
- Conditional logic
- Loops or iterations
- Additional imports
- Inline styles
- Props drilling

### Required Elements
✅ **MUST HAVE**:
- `'use client'` directive
- Default export function named `Home`
- Single `<QRGeneratorContainer />` render
- Protection header comment
- Performance tags (@protected, @performance-critical, @max-lines)

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Where to Add Features

| Feature Type | Location | File Path |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Business Logic | State Machine | `/hooks/useQRGeneratorOrchestrator.ts` |
| UI Components | Component Library | `/components/generator/*` |
| API Calls | Services | `/services/generatorServices.ts` |
| State Management | State Machine | `/types/generatorStates.ts` |
| Validation | Validators | `/lib/smartValidation.ts` |
| Styling | Component Files | Use Tailwind in components |

### Component Hierarchy
```
page.tsx (27 lines)
└── QRGeneratorContainer (Orchestrator)
    ├── GeneratorLayout
    ├── BarcodeTypeTabs
    ├── QRContentSelector
    ├── URLValidation / QRFormManager
    ├── GenerationControls
    └── PreviewSection
```

## 🔍 Review Process

### Automated Checks
1. **Guardian Tests** (`page.guardian.test.tsx`) run on every commit
2. **ESLint Rules** enforce import limits
3. **Bundle Size** monitoring in CI/CD
4. **Performance Metrics** tracked in monitoring

### Manual Review Required For:
- Any modification to `page.tsx`
- Changes to `QRGeneratorContainer`
- New features affecting main page
- Performance optimizations

### Approval Matrix
| Change Type | Required Approvers |
|------------|-------------------|
| Add import | Tech Lead + 2 Senior Devs |
| Add logic | REJECTED AUTOMATICALLY |
| Update comment | 1 Senior Dev |
| Performance optimization | Tech Lead + Performance Engineer |

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 2s
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 95
- **Bundle Size**: < 50KB for page.tsx chunk

### Monitoring Tools
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Synthetic monitoring
- Bundle analyzer
- Code complexity metrics

## 🚨 Violation Consequences

### Automatic Actions
1. **Build Failure**: Guardian tests block deployment
2. **PR Rejection**: Automated comment explaining violation
3. **Notification**: Alert to tech lead and original refactorer

### Remediation Steps
1. Revert changes
2. Move logic to appropriate location
3. Update tests if needed
4. Re-submit PR with corrections

**Remember**: This page is the face of our application. Every millisecond counts. Every line of code matters. Protect it like it's production... because it is.

*"The best code is no code. The second best is minimal code."*
