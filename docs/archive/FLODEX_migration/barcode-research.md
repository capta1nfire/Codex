# Barcode and QR Code Research for Massive Development (2025)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive research on the most used and relevant barcode and QR code types globally in 2025, with focus on massive code generation for a world-leading platform. CODEX implements complete support for all market-relevant types with special optimizations for critical ones.

## Classification and Global Relevance

Codes are classified into linear (1D) and matrix (2D). Their importance order is based on prevalence, global adoption, and versatility.

### Matrix Codes (2D)
1. **QR Code (Quick Response Code)**
2. **Data Matrix**

### Linear Codes (1D)
1. **EAN/UPC (EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E)**
2. **Code 128 (GS1-128)**
3. **ITF-14 (Interleaved 2 of 5)**
