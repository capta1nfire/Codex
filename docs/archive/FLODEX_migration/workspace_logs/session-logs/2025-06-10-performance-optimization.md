# Work Session Log: Performance Optimization
**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Duration**: ~3.5 hours  
**AI Agent**: Claude Opus 4

## 🎯 Session Goals
- [x] Fix QR v2 route errors (429 rate limiting)
- [x] Conduct performance audit
- [x] Implement optimizations
- [x] Document all changes

## 📁 Files Created
| File | Purpose | Keep? |
|------|---------|-------|
| `/backend/src/lib/httpClient.ts` | HTTP connection pooling | ✅ |
| `/backend/src/lib/prismaOptimized.ts` | DB connection pooling | ✅ |
| `/scripts/optimize-performance.sh` | Optimization script | ✅ |
| `/scripts/gradual-test-with-token.js` | Load testing tool | ✅ |
| `/scripts/direct-auth-test.js` | Auth testing | ✅ |
| `/scripts/debug-gradual-test.js` | Debug script | ❌ Deleted |
| `/scripts/test-auth.js` | Temp test | ❌ Deleted |
| `/.test-token.json` | Auth token | ❌ Deleted |
| `/docs/technical/performance-optimization-session-20250609.md` | Session report | ✅ |

## 🔧 Files Modified
1. **`/backend/src/services/barcodeService.ts`**
   - Added `fetchWithPool` import (line 6)
   - Updated fetch calls (lines 133, 262)

2. **`/backend/src/routes/generate.routes.ts`**
   - Changed to `authenticatedRateLimit` (line 52)
   - Added import (line 6)

3. **`/backend/src/routes/qr.routes.ts`**
   - Fixed validation middleware bug (line 179)

4. **`/docs/qr-engine/changelog.md`**
   - Added performance optimization section

5. **`/CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Added performance optimization summary
   - Added CLAUDE.md to reading order

## 📊 Results
- **Before**: 72.23 req/s max throughput
- **After**: 73.10 req/s (+1.2%)
- **Bottleneck**: Single-instance architecture
- **Target**: 300-500 req/s needs horizontal scaling

## 🛠️ Commands Used
```bash
# Testing
for i in {1..50}; do curl ... & done; wait

# Service management
pm2 restart codex-backend
pm2 logs codex-backend --err

# Cleanup
rm -f scripts/debug-gradual-test.js
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned
1. HTTP pooling alone isn't enough - need horizontal scaling
2. Rate limiter must check auth before applying limits
3. PM2 single instance is the main bottleneck
4. Good documentation structure helped navigation

## 🚀 Next Session Focus
- [ ] Implement PM2 clustering
- [ ] Set up Nginx load balancer for Rust
- [ ] Increase Rust concurrency limits
- [ ] Test multi-instance deployment
