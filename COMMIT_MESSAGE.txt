🔧 Technical Infrastructure: Complete TypeScript & Build System Stabilization

### 🎯 Primary Objectives Achieved
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors (20+ resolved)
- ✅ Stabilized ESLint configuration for long-term compatibility  
- ✅ Restored full testing functionality (8/8 tests passing)
- ✅ Eliminated unused code across 9+ components
- ✅ Ensured production-ready build pipeline

### 🛠️ Critical Fixes
- **TypeScript**: Added Vitest globals support in tsconfig.json
- **ESLint**: Downgraded to v8.57.0 for Next.js compatibility
- **Testing**: Fixed Vitest configuration with proper exclusions
- **Sentry**: Resolved deprecated API compatibility issues
- **CSS**: Added standard line-clamp properties for cross-browser support

### 📊 Build Quality Metrics
- Build: ❌ Failing → ✅ Successful (`npm run build`)
- Tests: ❌ Broken → ✅ 8/8 Passing (`npm test`)
- Linting: ⚠️ Unstable → ✅ Stable configuration
- Code Quality: ⚠️ 15+ warnings → ✅ Clean codebase

### 🚀 Production Impact
This stabilization ensures the development team can work efficiently without 
technical interruptions. All core development commands now function reliably,
establishing a solid foundation for future feature development.

### 📁 Files Modified
- tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.json, package.json
- vitest.config.ts, e2e/global-setup.ts
- src/app/globals.css, instrumentation files
